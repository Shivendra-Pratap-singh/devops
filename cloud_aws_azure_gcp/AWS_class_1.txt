What is cloud ?
---------------
"cloud" refers to servers that are accessed over the Internet, and we can run our applications / software and databases on those servers.
Cloud servers are located in data centers all over the world. 
By using cloud computing, users and companies do not have to manage physical servers themselves or run software applications on their own machines.


What is cloud computing?
------------------------

Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources (compute, storage, applications....) through a cloud services platform (AWS) via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.



Features of cloud computing:
---------------------------

• With cloud computing, we don’t need to make large up-front investments in hardware and spend a lot of time managing that hardware. Instead, we can provision exactly the right type and size of computing resources we need.

• With cloudcomputing, we can access as many resources as we need, almost instantly, and only pay for what we use.

•	Cloud computing provides an easy way to access servers, storage, databases, and a broad set of application services over the Internet.

•	Cloud computing providers such as AWS own and maintain the network- connected hardware required for these application services, 

Advantages of Cloud Computing:
------------------------------
•	Low cost
•	Usability
•	Bandwidth
•	Accessibility
•	Disaster Recovery
•	Secure

Cloud service providers / Platforms:
------------------------
amazon    -->    AWS    
microsoft -->    azure   
google    -->    gcp   






What is AWS Cloud Computing?
----------------------------
- Setting up Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources (compute, storage, applications....) through AWS cloud services platform  via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

- Accessing IT resources provided by cloud provider (AWS) through web.


- Three key words
 1. On – Demand (Whenever/whatever we need, we get immediately)
 2. Scalable (Increase and Decrease the configuration as per requirement)
 3. Pay only whatever you use
 

AWS HISTORY:
------------
•	AWS was launched in 2006.
•	Amazon converts the unused storage infrastructure as business “Simple Storage web service” S3.
•	By the end of 2006, Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) was launched.
•	Today AWS providing 70+ web services across 190 countries.
•	Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a secure cloud services platform, offering compute power, database storage, content delivery and other functionality to help businesses scale and grow.


AWS is located in 20 geographical locations called as "regions"

What is a Region?
-----------------
• Region is a distinct geographic location where amazon has its infrastructure.
• Each region will have a minimum of two availability zones.
• All the regions are designed to be independent of each other with	separate power sources,	internet connectivity and geographic location.



What is availability zone?
--------------------------
•	An availability zone is a separate datacenter within a region. Amazon has intentionally kept region independent of each other if one goes down it does not have effect on other.

For e.g:  amazon have 2 AZ in Mumbai ap-south-1a, ap-south-1b.

Note: 
=======================================================================================================

- Servers ==> CPU + RAM + HDD + OS

- Physical servers will be located inside company premises( also called as on premises) 

- Datacenter == on Premise servers ==> place where you will keep all your server ==> server room

Cloud:
======

Before cloud?
-------------
to start a small startup IT company 
- employees 
- rsoursec

zomato like application 
developers --> write code --> build --> deploy

things required to for this applications are?

1. servers?
------------
   High configuration server
    - 64 GB RAM
	-  1 TB HDD
	- 8 core cpu

 to buy 100 such servers we need to spend lot of money.
 
2. OS ?
--------
   windows --> licensed OS --> pay in thousands 
   linux --> free os --> use it for free 
   linux also has paid / licensed version with support to any problems in OS
 for licensed OS we need to spend money.


3. S/W ?
--------
  What if any pre requisite s/w is paid ?

we need to spend money.

4. Networking components:
-------------------------
  to purchse n/w components to enable communication betwen servers.
  networking components like switches, routers, modems & cables.
  
we need to spend money.

5. Maintainance:
----------------
   24 X 7 X 365 
   
we need to spend money for maintainance activities such as AC / Generator / security .

6. ADMINS:
----------
  Hire admin employees
  - Sys admin
  - N/W admin
  - DB admin
   
we need to spend money.


7. Time:
--------
  1 week time to assemble hardware components + install os + etc......



Conclusion on Physical setup / on premise setup ===> we need to spend lots & lots of money.

with cloud technology / cloud computing, we can overcome all the above 7 disadvantages, with very less ammount of money spent.

Note:
-----
what is Web traffic / traffic ?
--> Web traffic: incoming request + outgoing response from server

 eg: search any product (incoming request to server) & output (response from server)

what if traffic increases?
- load on system increases --> cpu utilization also increses --> goes beyond 100% ? --> server will get crashed? --> server / application will go down 
 
- we need to scale up resources to avoid such servers crashes.

approaching the above issue with cloud?
 
with Autoscaling feature: we can write a condition like 
 - if my CPU utilization goes more than 80% add 1 more server automatically.
 - if my CPU utilization goes lesser than 30% remove 1 more server automatically.

What are the layers available in cloud computing? 
------------------------------------------------
•	SaaS: Software as a Service 
•	PaaS: Platform as a Service
•	IaaS: Infrastructure as a Service
