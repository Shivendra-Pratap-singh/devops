What is an EIP?
-An Elastic IP address is a reserved static public IP address that you can assign to any EC2 instance.

##If additinal volume is not showing 
mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdb
mount /dev/xvdb /mnt


Types of Storage:
1.Direct-attached storage (DAS)
2.Network attached storage (NAS)
3.Storage area network (SAN)
4.Cloud Storage i.e. storage over Internet

1.Direct attached storage (DAS):
- Direct-attached storage (DAS) is attached directly to the computer system motherboard connectors or through usb. Examples of DAS include hard drives, CDROM/DVD ,
external hard drives, optical disc drives, pendrive etc.
- Amazon provide these facility through EBS (Elastic Block Storage service)

 2.Network-attached storage (NAS):
- NAS uses file-based protocols for sharing folders using NFS for Linux/UNIX.
- It is a shared folder over the network.
- Amazon provide these facility through EFS ( Elastic File system ) service.
- A shared folder cannot be formatted.

3. Storage Area Network (SAN):
- A storage-area network (SAN) is a dedicated high-speed network block level data storage, It can be formatted.
- Fiber cable, bus adapters (HBAs) and fiber switches are used to provide SAN storage.

4.Cloud storage:
- Cloud storage is a storage over internet provided by cloud service venders.
- It is not a block level storage i.e. cannot be formatted.
Eg.
Google drive
One drive
Dropbox
Amazon provides this services through
 1.S3 (Simple storage service )
 2.Glacier service


EBS main componets:
Volumes
Snapshot
Images

Types of Volumes:
1.EBS General Purpose (SSD=solid-state drive):
- General Purpose SSD (gp2 and gp3) volumes offer cost-effective storage.
- This volume type is suitable for small and medium workloads like Root disk EC2 volumes, small and medium database workloads, frequently logs accessing workloads, etc.
-By default, SSD supports 3 IOPS (Input Output Operations perSecond)/GB means 1 GB volume will give 3 IOPS, and 10 GB volume will give 30 IOPS. 

2.Provisioned IOPS (SSD):
- Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1 and io2) volumes provide low latency and are designed to meet the needs of I/O-intensive workloads. 
- They are best for EBS-optimized instances.
- This volume type is suitable for the most demanding I/O intensive, transactional workloads and large relational, EMR and Hadoop workloads, etc. 
- By default, IOPS SSD supports 30 IOPS/GB means 10GB volume will give 300 IOPS.

3.Throughput Optimized HDD(Hybrid Hard Drive):
- Throughput Optimized HDD (st1) volumes provide low-cost magnetic storage that is a good fit for large, sequential workloads.

4.Cold HDD:
- Cold HDD (sc1) volumes provide low-cost magnetic storage that offers lower throughput than st1.
- sc1 is a good fit for large, sequential cold-data workloads that require infrequent access to data.

5.EBS Magnetic Volumes:
- Magnetic (standard) volumes are best suited for workloads where data is accessed infrequently
- It was formerly known as standard volumes. This volume type is suitable for ideal workloads like infrequently accessing data, i.e. data backups for recovery, logs storage, etc. 
- Its storage capacity of one volume ranges from 10GB to 1TB. 
- The cost of one volume is $0.05 per GB for one month for provisioned storage and SO. 05 per million |/O requests.



Amazon Elastic Block Store : EBS
- Provides block level storage volumes for use with Amazon EC2 instances
a. Multiple volumes can be mounted to the same instance.
b. EBS volumes are network-attached, and independently from the life of an instance. 
c. Storage volumes behave like raw, unformatted block devices, allowing users to create a file system on top of Amazon EBS volumes,
   or use them in any other way you would use a block device (like a hard drive).
d. EBS volumes at one particular time can be attached to only one instance, it cannot be used with two or more instance at the same time.
e. Each EBS volume will have a volume id, which will be used by cloudwatch and other services,   
f. EBS volumes are placed in a specific Availability Zone, and can then be attached to instances also in that same Availability Zone.
g. Each storage volume is automatically replicated within the same Availability Zone. 
h. EBS provides the ability to create point-in-time snapshots of volumes, All snapshots are stored in s3 service of aws. 
  


What is difference  between Instance Store Volume(Root Volume) and an EBS Volume?:
- An Instance Store Volume is temporary storage that is used to store the temporary data required by an instance to function. 
- The data is available as long as the instance is running. As soon as the instance is turned off, the Instance Store Volume gets removed and the data gets deleted
- On the other hand, an EBS Volume represents a persistent storage disk. 
- The data stored in an EBS Volume will be available even after the instance is turned off.

Images(AMI):
- An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is a supported and maintained image provided by AWS
- Its like template to lunch ec2 instances(required packages)
- You must specify an AMI when you launch an instance
- You can launch multiple instances from a single AMI when you require multiple instances with the same configuration.
- You can use different AMIs to launch instances when you require instances with different configurations

EBS Snapshot:
- Snapshot are used to take EBS point-in-time backup.
- Snapshot are incremental back up of the EBS volume.
- Snapshots are region specific, where as volumes are specific to availability zones.

To increase the size of EBS Volumes first create the snapshots, then from this snapshot create the required size of volume
- Volume size cannot be decrease lesser than the snapshot size
- Volumes in another Availability zones can be created using snapshot
- To have the same volume in another region, first copy the snapshot in other region, then from this snapshot create the volume in required availability zones.
- Volumes are not deleted if snapshots are removed, similarly snapshots are not deleted if volumes are removed


S3 Bucket:
-Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service
 S3 Features:
 - scalability
 - availability
 - security
 - performance

There are different storage options for cost optimization:
1.Standard — General Purpose:
- This is the default storage and is used frequently.(with milliseconds access)
Eg: Big Data Analytics, mobile and gaming app, content distributions.

2.Standard — IA (Infrequent Access):
- This type of storage should be used when you are not using the data that often. When you use them, you need them rapidly.
- Cost is optimized from the general plan.
Eg: Datastore for the disaster recovery backups.
 
3.One Zone IA (Infrequent Access):
- Recreatable, infrequently accessed data (once a month) stored in a single Availability Zone with milliseconds access
- This one is cheaper than the previous S3 IA storage (< 20%).

4.Intelligent-Tiering:
- Data with changing or unknown access patterns
- If you do not know what to choose between General and IA plan storage, this one is for you.
- The less-used file will be moved to IA mode and others used in Standard storage mode.

5. Glacier Instant Retrieval:
- Long-lived archive data accessed once a quarter with instant retrieval in millisecond

6. Glacier Flexible Retrieval (formerly Glacier): 
- Long-lived archive data accessed once a year with retrieval of minutes to hours

7. Glacier Deep Archive:
- Long-lived archive data accessed less than once a year with retrieval of hours
- This storage is used when some data needs to be frozen for a certain period of time.
- Data can be retrieved quickly as listed in the fees plans below.
- They are cheap in price. Amazon Glacier Deep Archive is the cheapest

8. Reduced redundancy:
- Noncritical, frequently accessed data with milliseconds access (not recommended as S3 Standard is more cost effective)



Bucket naming rules:
- Bucket names must be between 3 (min) and 63 (max) characters long.
- Bucket names can consist only of lowercase letters, numbers, dots (.), and hyphens (-).
- Bucket names must begin and end with a letter or number.
- Bucket names must not contain two adjacent periods.
- Bucket names must not be formatted as an IP address (for example, 192.168.5.4).
- Bucket names must not start with the prefix xn--.
- Bucket names must not end with the suffix -s3alias. This suffix is reserved for access point alias names.
- Bucket names must be unique across all AWS accounts in all the AWS Regions within a partition. A partition is a grouping of Regions. AWS currently has three partitions: 
   aws (Standard Regions), aws-cn (China Regions), and aws-us-gov (AWS GovCloud (US)).
- A bucket name cannot be used by another AWS account in the same partition until the bucket is deleted.
- Buckets used with Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration can't have dots (.) in their names. For more information about Transfer 



EFS: Amazon Elastic File System
- Amazon EFS provides scalable file storage for use with Amazon EC2.
- You can use an EFS file system as a common data source for workloads and applications running on multiple instances
